            <br> <h6>lets design a ES for gate opening</h6>
            <p>Design an automatic gate opening system(purely hardware)
            <br>Requirements:</p>
            <ol>

            <p> 
              But we may not need all of the above components , to make it simple
              lets design simple with less number of components

            <h5 style="background-color:#ddd;float:center;text-align:center">Categories</h5>
            <p>all above said examples mostly comes under below categories
            <ul>
                <li> StandAlone </li>
                <li> RealTime </li>

                <li> Network </li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h6> StandAlone </h6>
            <p>
              > These are like Slave kind of behaving Embedded systems <br> 
              > Follows order blindly like semi-automatic washing machine <br>
              &ensp;&ensp;without pouring water, when we switch ON , it will rotate <br>
              &ensp;&ensp;without water, dont throw warning <br>
              > Dont StandAlone have Time constraints ? They do, but not mandatory.
            </p>

            <h6> RealTime </h6>
            <p>
              > O/P task will be perfomemed within given amount of time <br> 
              > time can be seconds, milli sec or even nano sec <br>
              &ensp;&ensp;<span style="color: purple">eg: AirBag System </span><br>

              &ensp;&ensp;<span style="color: purple">eg: FM Radio, Speakers </span><br>
            </p>

            <h6> Network </h6>
            <p>
              > Any device connected to Network and send data is Network ES <br> 
              &ensp;&ensp;<span style="color: purple">eg: Mobile Phone, Computer/PC/Laptops</span>  <br>
              &emsp;Smartphones can be said as both Mobile and Network ES, since it is movable and works on network based, <br> 
              &emsp;but MObile do lot of tasks, its not general purpose system <br> 
              &emsp;Then why mobiles comes under ES? Think over it...
            </p>

            <h6> Hybrid </h6>
            <p>
              > ES that falls under different category  <br>

            </p>

<h5 style="background-color:#ddd;float:center;text-align:center">Components</h5>
<p>
Most important component in ES is MicroCOntroller / MicroProcessor / Soc(System on Chip) <br>
SOC is more than 1 MU are integrated on single IC

      <div class="accordion-body">
       lets consider above example of <strong>Automatic Gate opening system</strong>
for metro stations...
they will open for everybody who is having metro coin(ticket) or smart card <br>  
In jewellery shop / warehouse, it will open for only employees with valid ID card <br>
<code> Step 1(Automatic Gate opening system) :</code> 
     we will save database of employees in cloud,
     gate will open only in Working hours, this has to be saved <br>
<code> Step 2(Jewellery shop) :</code>
     separate watchman databse should be there, since three shift of watchmen are there.<br>
     For owners, it should open 24/7 <br>
So complexity increases when requirements are increasing
so single MicroController cant handle all these
thats where SOC comes into picture, though the transition does limit overflow.
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<br>
<h6> Chip Selection </h6>
<p>
we can use Mu for gate openings system, 
if we change requirement like GATE should open only after Face recognisation <br>
> Face Scanning component like Camera <br>
> software to calcuate face matching ratio <br>
> access to cloud memory to store images on Cloud, since images will be large <br>
> DSP to process images <br>
> wifi <br>
> SOC <br>
</p>


Earlier , we used only micro controller , since its simple gate opening system
now, there are more requirement, so we using Microprocessor now

Memory :
--------
1. RAM(SRAM/DRAM)
  > RAM is volatile memory, memory got cleared out when system turns off 
  > Random Access memory means we can fetch any memory randomly
    no restrictions on fetching any byte
  types of RAM:
  -------------
  --> SRAM (Static RAM)
      > Buidling block of Memory is called is Memorycell
      > one memory cell having 4 transistors
      > Data need not be refreshed again and again
  --> DRAM(Dyanmic RAM)
      > one memory cell having 1 transistor and 1 cap
      > data need to refresged again and again
      > it is similar to ShortTerm Memory loss(Gajini)

2. ROM
  > ROM, is permanent memory(non-volatile)
    memory will retain even after system turned off
  > Read only Memory(Only Once write is possible),can read 'n' times
  types of ROM:
 --------------
  --> PROM(Programmable Memory) / OTP(one time programmable)
      memory can be programmable only once
      where software update is not needed again and again,
      like home applicances, Toys
  --> EPROM(Electrically Programmable Memory) / UVROM(UV programmble Mem)
      can be erased and re-programmable using UV rays/electrical 
      It cant be part of Customer product, since we cant ask them to pass
      UV rays eveytime
      > R&D areas, For testing and evaluation of codes on hardware
  --> MASKED ROM (Particular memory is masked)
      a part of memory is non-erasable(masked from getting damaged)
      it can be part of IC where manufacturing data of that IC or lot number


3. Hybdird Memory
-----------------
🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️
A person has taken a picture, which memory would you suggest store?
RAM or ROM?
we would say ROM, since we need it...
but what if picture is blurry ? we cant save it to ROM, 
sicne ROM is single time writable, and we cant change it again
RAM is also not a good idea

TO avoid this, we will use Hybrid Memories

Hybrid Memories = RAM + ROM
    = write n times + data gets retained
🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️

  EEPROM :
  --> it will take around 1.5ms, write is slow 
  --> but read is faster, so we will use EEPROM for small data/few bytes
      if we want to write 500 bytes, it is taking 750ms
  NAND FLASH & NOR FLASH :
  --> these are block memory, block size varies from 256 bytes to 16kb
  --> in general, will store 
      > data in NAND FLASH
      > code in NOR FLASH
  --> becuase, NOR FLASH support xip((eXecute In Place)
  but when we load our code which is of size 4.5 MB into MicroController, 
  while running, exectuable file willget loaded to RAM inside MicroController
  RAM size in general would be in Kb's, 4KB in 8051 MC
  NOR FLASH make this possible wihtout loading code into RAM, 
  it will run file where it is



4. Sensors :
------------
  > Data read by sensors is sent to ADC and Analog inputs read by sensor
  is , and converted to Digital output, 

5. ADC & DAC  
------------
  > DAC converts again Digital to Analog to Actuators which turns Windmill

6. LED to show power in Laptops
-------------------------------
  > Human INterface

7. FPGA & ASIC 
--------------
    FPGA(Field programmable gate array) and ASIC(Application Specific Integrated Ciruit)
    we can design FPGA again and again, but once ASIC is designed, 
    we cant redesign ASIC again
    If we are not sure about our design, we will test our model with FPGA
    if design is working fine with good results, then we will build ASIC
    if more number are there, we will use ASIC , if less no we will FPGA

8. Diagnostic Port
------------------
   it can alaysis ports in system

9. Auxilary System(Power, Cooling)
----------------------------------
   Designing of power supply, diff components on different voltage supply
   
10. Software
------------
  Embedded software

=============================================================================

____________
Requirements
____________

--> Reliability
    we will see how long the product will work, we are purchasing
    if product dont work atleast that time, so reliability places imp role
   
--> cost-effectivness
    Product we are deisnging should be cost-effective, not everyone purchase
    Apple phone, most of the people buy Android

--> Low Power Consumption
    It should consume less power
    
--> Efficient Usage of Processing Power
    ES we designed should use power efficiently
    
    lets say we are designing water pumping system, which pumps water
    daily at 8'0 clock
    --> we need timer to pump water at given time
    --> we need pump to run 24/7 , so we will use battery
    power is needed 24/7 only for timer, when time arrives, then power should
    flow for period of time till 1hour
    so battery will drain, we need to give above change to ES design
    8A.M-9A.M --> MC should work for 1hour
    
    so builtin timer wont be good here, using RTC(Real Time clock) chip is good option
    it consumes less power(micro Amp)
    
    we will set INT should occur when 8'0 is happened in RTC
    then MicroController is activated
    again at 9'0 clocok, one more INTerrupt will stops MC

--> Efficient Usage of Memory
    only infinite loop will consume 100% memory
    so better avoid using them if not necessary

--> Embedding an OS
    scheduling algorithms

--> Code Optmisazation
    to optimize code, which runs in less time using less memory resource
    we need more experience
--> Testing and Debugging
    When product is not tested properly, brand value will be down
    > Samsung note7 phones are not allowed in airpots, since it got blasted
    > Iphone is quality product, but few days back, they wanted to approach
      their own maps rather than google maps, but its not working as
      GoogleMAPS
    > Tato Nano cars even though its cost-effective, production got stopped
      since 2-3 cars got blasted
    These things happened due to improper testing, which brings those
    companies brand value down

    
           

<h5>Trends in Development</h5>

Depending on req of design, we will choose
1. Processor
2. Memory
   when its comes to Data saving, use NAND FLASH is best
   when its comes to code, using NOR FLASH recommended, since it support xip
3. OS
4. Programming languages
   If its boot loader, using Assembly makes it faster
   if its GUI, python/Java is good
5. Development Tools
   we can use IDE based on our requirement
   


<h5>Common design metrics</h5>

1. Time to Prototype
   > Prototype is basic model of main product
   > Dont waste time in prototype, since it delays final product to market
   > someone might come to market with some other product by then

2. Power
   > make sure, given power is enough to run all component on board with less

3. Performanc3 & Correctness

4. Size
   > keeo handy in size

5. NRE
   > Non-reccuring engineering cost
   > say a product has 3 parts ( A+B+C)
   > all 3 parts A,B,C are developed, when client comes said, 
   > change C, its again takes time to chang e with new C part

6. Maintainability & Flexibility

7. Safety
  > ES are deployed where humans are there, so safety is most important

8. Unit cost

9. Time to market
   > first money is important in Competitors
      
<h4>GPS Vs ES difference</h4>

what is GPS ?
System designed for general activities
eg: Computer
we use it for office work, 
moms will use it cooking videos
Fathers use it for Excel work
Siblings use it for games or project work

Mobile phone, we can do all above said, in better way
But MObile phone is considered as ES, why ?

###############################################
A system using which u design a ES, its not ES
Its GPS
ES developed using some other ES is GPS
###############################################

Gate opening system cant be deisgned using other Gate Opening system
Google car - NO , ES
Computer   - YES, GPS

Mobile phone with mobile - YES
but we dont use it since
> Nice Big screen
> Keyboard



Does the size matter wither ur using ES or GPS
--> Bluetooth button
--> industrial control systems


__________________
Real time Systems:
__________________
If your system is capable of taking action on given instant within specified
amount of time, then its RTS


Hard Real Time 
--------------
Should meet its deadline - Life Critical Application
eg:-
Airbags, PaceMakers, Missiles

Firm Real Time
---------------
Similar to Hard Real time - Properties
Because of Failure, if large investment is being lost, then its Firm real time
system
Money is important in Firm Real time system
Eg:-
Moon Rover, either crash landing or landing and losing communication
here money, time invested are lost, not human lives


Soft Real Time
--------------
can have Tolerance in meeting its deadline
eg:-
Vending machine, OVEN, water pumping system




Questions for You
=================
Stand-Alone is ES which follows instructions blindy without any error check, this is what said in yesterdays class
is it crt ?
we can write single program for these Hierarchial validations, isn't it ?
