What is Embedded Systems ?
INTRO to MicroControllers
Embedded Programming
Communication Protocols



3 topics convered under INTRO to Embedded Systems
_________________________________________________
> Introduction to ES
> GPS(General Purpose System) Vs ES
> Real Time Aspects



1. Introduction to ES
---------------------
Q) what is ES
Newtons 3rd law 
"for every action there is an equal and opp reaction"
this wont change anywhere in world , who ever we ask, they would say same
but when we ask someone , what is ES?
we will get different answers....
so to avoid confusion, whatever may be our answer, make sure 3 words are
there in your defintion

1. Hardware
2. Software
3. SpecificTask
#####################################################################
A combination of H/W and S/W which is intended to do a SPECIFIC TASK
is called Embedded System
#####################################################################

lets design a ES for gate opening
----------------------------------
Design an automatic gate opening system(purely hardware)
req:
> when person enters, gate should open
> when person leaves through gate, it should close


proximity switch, pneumatic system to open the gate
Proximity sensor, driver, controller, motor
motion sensor, sensor switch

Power Converter(AC-DC),IR Sensor,Relay/Motor Driver(Frwd/Reverse),Motor,Motion Sensor or Optical Sensor (To Detect anyone Near to Gate),Emergency Switch to Open,Required Microcontroller.

Arduino


1. Sensor(IR)
2. Relay
3. COmponent to keep how long gate should open and close
   > Timer
4. to compare output from sensor to check
   > comparator
above things alone wont make it as ES
ES  = H/W  +   S/W   + Specific task
❌  = ✔️  +   ❌   + ✔️

=============================================================================
________
Examples
________

Fan in our room , is not ES
but Fan speed controlleed automatically based on Room temp, is ES
 other examples are 
Washing machine
Dvd player
atm
Temperature controller
Medical Products like MRI,CT Scan;CCTV DVR;Drones
washing machine, microwave
Smart watch
Ac
Smart TV
Water level controller
VT
refrigerators
Missiles
video game consoles
Water vending machine
Robotic car
Calibration system for sensors
mobile phones
mp3 players
escalators
infotainment system in car

____________________________________________________________
all above said examples mostly comes under below categories
____________________________________________________________ 
Home APplicances
Video Secuity Cam
Automotive electronics
RObotics
Flight controls
Medical Imaging
Routers
Space Rovers
Missile
Smart Phones

=============================================================================

Categories
__________

StandAlone  > Slave behaving
      > Follows order blindly like semi-automatic washing machine
      without pouring water, when we switch ON , it will rotate
      without water, dont throw warning
      > Dont StandAlone have Time constraints ?
        ???????????????????????????????????????????
        
RealTime  > O/P task will be perfomemed within given amount of time
    > time can be seconds, milli sec or even nano sec
    eg: AirBag System

Mobile  > Any portable ES is called Mobile ES
Network > Any device connected to Network and send data is Network ES

Smartphones can be said as both Mobile and Network ES, since it is movable
and works on network based, 
but MObile do lot of tasks, its not general purpose system
?????????????????????????????????
THen why mobiles comes under ES?
?????????????????????????????????

Hybrid  > same ES that falls under different category 

=============================================================================
___________
Components
___________

MOst important component is
MicroCOntroller / MicroProcessor / Soc(System on Chip)
SOC - more than 1 MU are integrated on single IC

Q. When to go with MC and Soc ?
lets consider above example of Automatic Gate opening system
for metro stations...
they will open for everybody
IN jewellery shop / warehouse, it will open for only employees with valid ID card
Step 1 --> we will save database of employees in cloud
     gate will open only in Working hours, this has to be saved
Step 2 --> separate watchman databse should be there, 
     since three shift of wathcman are there
     for owners, it should open 24/7
So complexity increases when requirements are increasing
so single MicroController cant handler all these
thats where SoC comes into picture    

Chip Selection
--------------
we can use Mu for gate openings syste
if we change requirement like GATE should open only after Face recognisation
> Face Scanning component like Camera
> software to calcuate face matching ratio
> access to cloud memory to store images on Cloud, since images will be large
> DSP to process images
> wifi
> SOC

Earlier , we used only micro controller , since its simple gate opening system
now, there are more requirement, so we using Microprocessor now

Memory :
--------
1. RAM(SRAM/DRAM)
  > RAM is volatile memory, memory got cleared out when system turns off 
  > Random Access memory means we can fetch any memory randomly
    no restrictions on fetching any byte
  types of RAM:
  -------------
  --> SRAM (Static RAM)
      > Buidling block of Memory is called is Memorycell
      > one memory cell having 4 transistors
      > Data need not be refreshed again and again
  --> DRAM(Dyanmic RAM)
      > one memory cell having 1 transistor and 1 cap
      > data need to refresged again and again
      > it is similar to ShortTerm Memory loss(Gajini)

2. ROM
  > ROM, is permanent memory(non-volatile)
    memory will retain even after system turned off
  > Read only Memory(Only Once write is possible),can read 'n' times
  types of ROM:
 --------------
  --> PROM(Programmable Memory) / OTP(one time programmable)
      memory can be programmable only once
      where software update is not needed again and again,
      like home applicances, Toys
  --> EPROM(Electrically Programmable Memory) / UVROM(UV programmble Mem)
      can be erased and re-programmable using UV rays/electrical 
      It cant be part of Customer product, since we cant ask them to pass
      UV rays eveytime
      > R&D areas, For testing and evaluation of codes on hardware
  --> MASKED ROM (Particular memory is masked)
      a part of memory is non-erasable(masked from getting damaged)
      it can be part of IC where manufacturing data of that IC or lot number


3. Hybdird Memory
-----------------
🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️
A person has taken a picture, which memory would you suggest store?
RAM or ROM?
we would say ROM, since we need it...
but what if picture is blurry ? we cant save it to ROM, 
sicne ROM is single time writable, and we cant change it again
RAM is also not a good idea

TO avoid this, we will use Hybrid Memories

Hybrid Memories = RAM + ROM
    = write n times + data gets retained
🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️🚂️

  EEPROM :
  --> it will take around 1.5ms, write is slow 
  --> but read is faster, so we will use EEPROM for small data/few bytes
      if we want to write 500 bytes, it is taking 750ms
  NAND FLASH & NOR FLASH :
  --> these are block memory, block size varies from 256 bytes to 16kb
  --> in general, will store 
      > data in NAND FLASH
      > code in NOR FLASH
  --> becuase, NOR FLASH support xip((eXecute In Place)
  but when we load our code which is of size 4.5 MB into MicroController, 
  while running, exectuable file willget loaded to RAM inside MicroController
  RAM size in general would be in Kb's, 4KB in 8051 MC
  NOR FLASH make this possible wihtout loading code into RAM, 
  it will run file where it is



4. Sensors :
------------
  > Data read by sensors is sent to ADC and Analog inputs read by sensor
  is , and converted to Digital output, 

5. ADC & DAC  
------------
  > DAC converts again Digital to Analog to Actuators which turns Windmill

6. LED to show power in Laptops
-------------------------------
  > Human INterface

7. FPGA & ASIC 
--------------
    FPGA(Field programmable gate array) and ASIC(Application Specific Integrated Ciruit)
    we can design FPGA again and again, but once ASIC is designed, 
    we cant redesign ASIC again
    If we are not sure about our design, we will test our model with FPGA
    if design is working fine with good results, then we will build ASIC
    if more number are there, we will use ASIC , if less no we will FPGA

8. Diagnostic Port
------------------
   it can alaysis ports in system

9. Auxilary System(Power, Cooling)
----------------------------------
   Designing of power supply, diff components on different voltage supply
   
10. Software
------------
  Embedded software

=============================================================================

____________
Requirements
____________

--> Reliability
    we will see how long the product will work, we are purchasing
    if product dont work atleast that time, so reliability places imp role
   
--> cost-effectivness
    Product we are deisnging should be cost-effective, not everyone purchase
    Apple phone, most of the people buy Android

--> Low Power Consumption
    It should consume less power
    
--> Efficient Usage of Processing Power
    ES we designed should use power efficiently
    
    lets say we are designing water pumping system, which pumps water
    daily at 8'0 clock
    --> we need timer to pump water at given time
    --> we need pump to run 24/7 , so we will use battery
    power is needed 24/7 only for timer, when time arrives, then power should
    flow for period of time till 1hour
    so battery will drain, we need to give above change to ES design
    8A.M-9A.M --> MC should work for 1hour
    
    so builtin timer wont be good here, using RTC(Real Time clock) chip is good option
    it consumes less power(micro Amp)
    
    we will set INT should occur when 8'0 is happened in RTC
    then MicroController is activated
    again at 9'0 clocok, one more INTerrupt will stops MC

--> Efficient Usage of Memory
    only infinite loop will consume 100% memory
    so better avoid using them if not necessary
    



=============================================================================
_____________
Challengings
_____________

--> Efficient Inputs/Outputs
  ___
 |MC |
 | ? |_________
 |___|    |
    |
      /
     /  (switch)
    |
        -----
         ---
          -
         GND
  when switch is close
  Floating socket(switch is open)
  EMI will occur(getting output even without input given)


--> Embedding an OS
    scheduling algorithms

--> Code Optmisazation
    to optimize code, which runs in less time using less memory resource
    we need more experience
--> Testing and Debugging
    When product is not tested properly, brand value will be down
    > Samsung note7 phones are not allowed in airpots, since it got blasted
    > Iphone is quality product, but few days back, they wanted to approach
      their own maps rather than google maps, but its not working as
      GoogleMAPS
    > Tato Nano cars even though its cost-effective, production got stopped
      since 2-3 cars got blasted
    These things happened due to improper testing, which brings those
    companies brand value down

    
           
=============================================================================
_____________
Tends in Dev
_____________

Depending on req of design, we will choose

1. Processor
2. Memory
   when its comes to Data saving, use NAND FLASH is best
   when its comes to code, using NOR FLASH recommended, since it support xip
3. OS
4. Programming languages
   If its boot loader, using Assembly makes it faster
   if its GUI, python/Java is good
5. Development Tools
   we can use IDE based on our requirement
   




=============================================================================
_____________________
Common design metrics
_____________________

1. Time to Prototype
   > Prototype is basic model of main product
   > Dont waste time in prototype, since it delays final product to market
   > someone might come to market with some other product by then

2. Power
   > make sure, given power is enough to run all component on board with less

3. Performanc3 & Correctness

4. Size
   > keeo handy in size

5. NRE
   > Non-reccuring engineering cost
   > say a product has 3 parts ( A+B+C)
   > all 3 parts A,B,C are developed, when client comes said, 
   > change C, its again takes time to chang e with new C part

6. Maintainability & Flexibility

7. Safety
  > ES are deployed where humans are there, so safety is most important

8. Unit cost

9. Time to market
   > first money is important in Competitors
      
=============================================================================


----------------- GPS Vs ES difference  ----------------------------

what is GPS ?
System designed for general activities
eg: Computer
we use it for office work, 
moms will use it cooking videos
Fathers use it for Excel work
Siblings use it for games or project work

Mobile phone, we can do all above said, in better way
But MObile phone is considered as ES, why ?

###############################################
A system using which u design a ES, its not ES
Its GPS
ES developed using some other ES is GPS
###############################################

Gate opening system cant be deisgned using other Gate Opening system
Google car - NO , ES
Computer   - YES, GPS

Mobile phone with mobile - YES
but we dont use it since
> Nice Big screen
> Keyboard



Does the size matter wither ur using ES or GPS
--> Bluetooth button
--> industrial control systems


__________________
Real time Systems:
__________________
If your system is capable of taking action on given instant within specified
amount of time, then its RTS


Hard Real Time 
--------------
Should meet its deadline - Life Critical Application
eg:-
Airbags, PaceMakers, Missiles

Firm Real Time
---------------
Similar to Hard Real time - Properties
Because of Failure, if large investment is being lost, then its Firm real time
system
Money is important in Firm Real time system
Eg:-
Moon Rover, either crash landing or landing and losing communication
here money, time invested are lost, not human lives


Soft Real Time
--------------
can have Tolerance in meeting its deadline
eg:-
Vending machine, OVEN, water pumping system




Questions for You
=================
Stand-Alone is ES which follows instructions blindy without any error check, this is what said in yesterdays class
is it crt ?
we can write single program for these Hierarchial validations, isn't it ?
